# Image Enhancement of an intentionally damaged Panda image
This work is done in Python with OpenCV and shows alternative methods to enhancing an image with both periodic and random noise. A measurement is taken before and after to see improvements.
To run this yourself, install all dependencies:
- pip3 install opencv-python
- pip3 install numpy
- pip3 install matplotlib
- pip3 install scipy
- pip3 install scikit-image
Then run either of the files with:
python3 ImageEnhancement1.py
or
python3 ImageEnhancement2.py

Any issues please raise them with me.
